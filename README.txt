Overview
========

LNgen  generates statements  and proofs  of "infrastructure"  lemmas for
locally nameless  representations in the [Coq proof  assistant] [1].  It
takes as  input language definitions  written in the  [Ott specification
language]  [2].  In  its  current  iteration, LNgen  is  not a  complete
replacement for Ott's Coq back end:  the output from LNgen relies on the
definitions generated by Ott.

Dependencies
============

* [GHC](http://www.haskel.org/ghc/)  is  required  in order  to  compile
  LNgen.  The 6.10 release is known to work.

* LNgen's  output must  be combined  with the  output from  *a modified*
  version of Ott.  Obtain Ott from

    <http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/ott/>

  Follow the directions in LNgen's `patches` directory for patching Ott.

* LNgen's output requires a copy of Penn's metatheory library.  The most
  recent version of the library can be found at

    <http://www.plclub.org/metalib/>

  For convenience, a  version that is compatible with  LNgen is included
  in this  directory, and  the symlink `metatheory`  points to  it.  The
  library comes with its own documentation and build instructions.


Building LNgen
==============

You can use either the Haskell tools `cabal` or `stack` to build lngen.
	  
To compile and run with cabal (new style, uses system GHC)

	  cabal new-build
	  cabal new-exec lngen  <command line flags, see below>

To compile and run with stack (downloads GHC 8.0.1)

          stack build
	  stack exec lngen <command line flags, see below>

To compile with cabal (old style, installs lngen in your path):

          cabal v1-build
	  lngen


Using LNgen
===========

1. Write an Ott specification for your language, e.g., `lang.ott`,
   keeping in mind the restrictions below.

2. Run `ott` on the specification to produce a Coq file containing the
   language's definitions, e.g.,

        ott --coq lang_ott.v lang.ott

3. Run `lngen` on the specification to produce a Coq file containing
   additional infrastructure for the language, e.g.,

        lngen --coq lang_inf.v lang.ott


Options
=======

The following options to `lngen` may be useful:

* --coq-admitted : Tells LNgen to  emit every infrastructure lemma as an
  axiom.   This  is useful  if  you're  still  tweaking your  language's
  definition   and  do   not  wish   to  spend   time   recompiling  the
  infrastructure file.

* --coq-loadpath dir : Tells LNgen to include a line

        Add LoadPath "dir".

  at the  beginning of  the file that  it generates.  For  example, this
  option can be used to  specify the directory containing the metatheory
  library.

* --coq-no-proofs : Same as --coq-admitted.

* --coq-ott lib : Tells LNgen to include a line

        Require Import lib.

  at the  beginning of  the file that  it generates.  For  example, this
  option can  be used  to `Require` the  library generated by  Ott.  (In
  fact, LNgen's output won't compile without it.)


Restrictions on Ott specifications
==================================

* LNgen handles  no more than  what Ott's locally nameless  back-end can
  handle.  In  particular, LNgen doesn't  handle multi-substitutions and
  list forms.

* Every `metavar` that is used as a binder must include

        {{ repr-locally-nameless }}

  as a homomorphism.

* LNgen reads only the initial part  of a single Ott file.  This initial
  part should be ordered as follows:

      * `metavar` declarations
      * a `grammar` block
      * a `substitutions` block
      * a `freevars` block

  Anything after  this initial part will  be ignored by  LNgen but still
  processed by Ott.  Note that  you may declare `indexvar`s and `embed`s
  between the parts listed above.

  The  initial `grammar` block  should include  only those  grammars for
  which you  expect Ott to  generate an inductive  datatype declaration.
  The initial  `substitutions` and `freevars` blocks  must declare names
  for all possible (sensible) substitution and free-variables functions.


Examples
========

The `examples` directory contains examples of Ott specifications and the
corresponding  outputs generated by  Ott and  LNgen.  Each  example uses
`LoadPath` directives and symlinks to import copy the metatheory library
that  comes  with  the  LNgen  distribution.  The  README  file  in  the
`examples` directory contains additional information about each example.

To compile the Coq code for all the examples, run `make examples`.
